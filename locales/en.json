In order to ensure stable operation and to implement various features in our client application, as well as to provide you with a wider range of services and functionalities, Software Development Kits (SDKs) or similar applications from our business partners may be integrated into our application. We enforce strict measures to ensure the security of the SDKs and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) through which our business partners access information. We supervise the use of the SDKs and APIs to ensure that they comply with the Privacy Policy and other privacy and security measures in handling personal information to protect data security.\n6.2. When you use our product/services, you agree that the business partners whose SDKs are integrated into our application will directly collect and process your personal information. You understand that the third-party SDKs and similar applications are operated by the respective third parties, and the handling of your personal information is subject to their terms of service and privacy statements (in addition to the \"Privacy Policy\").\n6.3. Jpush SDK\nThird-party name: Shenzhen Hexun Huagu Information Technology Co., Ltd.\nPurpose: Implement message push (or other push features)\nProcessing method: De-identification, encrypted transmission and processing\nTypes of collected personal information: device information (IMEI, MAC address, Android ID, IDFA, OAID, OpenUDID, GUID, IMSI on SIM, etc.), network information, and location information (IP address, Wi-Fi, base station, etc.), and list of installed apps.\nLink to the third-party privacy policy or official website:\nhttps://www.jiguang.cn/license/privacy\nNotes:\n1. This application requires the use of auto-launch to implement features such as message push and data statistics. This means that broadcasts are sent by the system at a certain frequency to trigger the application's auto-launch or associated launch, which is necessary to implement certain features and services. When there is a change in your network connectivity, a notification will appear in the notification bar to inform you about the current network status. Without your explicit consent, no auto-launch or associated launch will happen.\n2. The Jpush SDK runs in the background to read the list of installed packages so that it can push messages to users as soon as they open the application. During its operation in the background, the SDK only retrieves the list of packages installed on the application and does not access any other sensitive information.\n\n6.4 Types of personal information we may collect after integration with Tencent Browser Service\nTo implement specific features of various Tencent Browser Service SDKs, it may be necessary for us to collect personal information from developers or end-users. The following describes various features of Tencent Browser Service SDKs and the personal information we may collect to implement these features:\n1. To accurately control the distribution of kernel versions and switches, based on the webview standard protocol, we need to obtain users' mobile phone model to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the service.\n2. To make it easier for users to find and share copied content, we need to access the clipboard and read the links and content on it. This allows us to implement features such as search and sharing.\n\n7. Who your personal data may be shared with\n7.1.
